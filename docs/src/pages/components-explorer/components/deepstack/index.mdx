DeepStack is a self-hosted, free and open source AI server that provides object detection and face recognition, among other functions.<br/>
It is highly optimized and runs on a pleathora of devices and platforms.<br/>
Below is quoted from DeepStacks [documentation](https://docs.deepstack.cc/index.html):

> DeepStack is an AI server that empowers every developer in the world to easily build state-of-the-art AI systems both on premise and in the cloud. The promises of Artificial Intelligence are huge but becoming a machine learning engineer is hard. DeepStack is device and language agnostic. You can run it on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Raspberry PI and use it with any programming language.<br/>
> DeepStack's source code is available on GitHub via https://github.com/johnolafenwa/DeepStack<br/>
> DeepStack is developed and maintained by [DeepQuest AI](https://deepquestai.com/)
