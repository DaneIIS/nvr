The Coral EdgeTPU provides fast, efficient, private and offline AI inferencing capabilities in multiple form factors, such as a USB accessory or a PCIe module.

:::tip

The `edgetpu` component can also run on the CPU with compatible Tensorflow Lite models.

## Configuration

<details>
  <summary>Configuration example</summary>

```yaml
edgetpu:

### Pre-trained models

The included models are placed inside the `/detectors/models/edgetpu` folder.

There are three models:

- SSD MobileNet V2
- EfficientDet-Lite3
- SSDLite MobileDet

The default model is EfficientDet-Lite3 because it features higher precision than the others, with a slightly higher latency.

More information on these models, as well as more object detector models can be found on the [coral.ai website](https://coral.ai/models/object-detection/)

## Image classification

<ImageClassification />

### Labels

<ImageClassificationLabels />

### Pre-trained models

The included model is MobileNet V3.
It is placed inside the `/classifiers/models/edgetpu` folder.
It was chosen because it has high accuracy and low latency.

More image classification models can be found on the [coral.ai website](https://coral.ai/models/image-classification/)

There you will also find information to help you understand if you might want to switch to another model.
