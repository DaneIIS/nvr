The GStreamer integration reads frames from your cameras for processing by Viseron.

Viseron uses the `gst-launch-1.0` command to interface with GStreamer.

Hardware acceleration is available and automatically used for the `NVIDIA Jetson Nano`.

:::note

As of now the `gstreamer` integration uses FFmpeg to create recordings when an object is detected and FFprobe to read stream information.
Therefore, if you make changes to the `recorder` config you should keep in mind that it is in FFmpeg syntax.

## Configuration

  <summary>Configuration example</summary>

```yaml
gstreamer:
  camera:
    camera_one:
      name: Camera 1
      host: 192.168.XX.XX
      port: 554
      path: /Streaming/Channels/101/

## Camera

### MJPEG Streams

### GStreamer pipeline

Viseron will try to generate a suitable decoder pipeline.

As of now only the `Jetson Nano` has a special pipeline which utilizes hardware acceleration.

If you have experience working with GStreamer, please suggest other pipelines in a PR or an issue!

### GStreamer audio pipeline

If your camera has audio, an audio pipeline will be automatically added to the GStreamer command.

The pipeline is rather crude and always re-encodes the audio to `aac`.
This is not optimal, but it works. Hopefully this will be improved in the future.

The default audio pipeline looks like this in YAML format:

```yaml
audio_pipeline:
  - "input_stream."
  - "!"
  - "queue"
  - "!"
  - "decodebin"
  - "!"
  - "audioconvert"
  - "!"
  - "queue"
  - "!"
  - "voaacenc"
  - "!"
  - "mux.audio_0"
```

### FFprobe Stream Information

Viseron needs to know the width, height, FPS and audio/video codecs of your stream.<br />
FFprobe is used on initialization to figure all this information out.

Some cameras dont play nice with this and fail to report some information.<br />
To circumvent this you can manually specify all these options.

If you specify all of `width`, `height`, `fps`, `codec` and `audio_codec`, Viseron will not need to call FFprobe and startup will be significantly faster.

### Recoverable Errors

GStreamer occasionally prints error messages which are of no real significance.

To suppress an error you can add a subset of that error to the `gstreamer_recoverable_errors` config option.

```yaml
gstreamer_recoverable_errors:
  - error while decoding MB
```

### Rotating video

If you rotate your camera 90 or 180 degrees, you can rotate the video in Viseron to match.<br />
To do this you can use the `output_element` and `video_filters` option in the config.<br />

:::note

If you are rotating the video 90 degrees, you need to tell Viseron the width and height of the video, which should be the opposite of the cameras real resolution.
If you have a camera with 1920x1080 resolution, you need to set `width: 1080` and `height: 1920` in the config.

  <summary>Config to rotate 90 degrees clockwise</summary>

```yaml title="/config/config.yaml"
gstreamer:
  camera:
    camera_one:
      name: Camera 1
      host: 192.168.XX.X
      port: 554
      path: /Streaming/Channels/101/
      username: !secret camera_one_user
      password: !secret camera_one_pass
      output_element: "videoflip method=clockwise !" # Rotate the frames processed by Viseron
      width: 1080 # Width of the rotated video = height of the camera
      height: 1920 # Height of the rotated video = width of the camera
      recorder:
        idle_timeout: 5
        video_filters: # Rotate the recorded videos, handled by FFmpeg as of now.
          - transpose=1
```

</details>

### Raw pipeline

If you want to use a custom GStreamer pipeline, you can do so by specifying the `raw_pipeline` option.
Viseron needs to be able to read frames, so you must make sure to output frames to stdout.
By default this is done using the `fdsink` element, but other elements might work as well.

You also need to make sure that you are outputting frames in the raw format (`video/x-raw`) that Viseron expects.

The third consideration is that small segments need to be saved to disk for processing by the recorder.
This is done by using the `splitmuxsink` element.

Last but not least, if you create a pipeline that works well for your particular hardware, please consider contributing it to Viseron, either by opening a PR or an issue.
