Image classification runs as a <Link href="/docs/documentation/configuration#post-processors">post processor</Link> when a specific object is detected.

Image classification works by labeling and image with known objects and provide a score.
Classifiers have more fine tuned models than object detectors typically have, which allows them to have more detailed detections.

The downside to this is that classifiers can only give one result, unlike object detectors who can detect multiple different objects in a frame.

_But_, if you combine the two you can achieve some cool results.<br />
For instance, you could set up the object detector look for `bird`, and the image classifier with a model that is trained to recognize different birds.
