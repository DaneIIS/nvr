License plate recognition runs as a <Link href="/docs/documentation/configuration#post-processors">post processor</Link> when a specific object is detected.

You can track known license plates by adding them to the `known_plates` list in the configuration.
Known plates will be reported as binary sensors.

There is also a sensor entity that reports **all** the plates that have been detected.
This can be used to trigger actions in other platforms, eg Home Assistant, when an unknown plate is detected.
