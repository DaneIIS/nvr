# Components

Viserons config consists of [components](/components-explorer).<br />
Every component provides different sets of domains (such as cameras, object detection, motion detection etc).<br />
These domains are then tied together, providing the full capabilities of Viseron.

Components generally implement at least one domain.

:::info

You can mix and match components freely. For example you could use different object detectors for different cameras.
