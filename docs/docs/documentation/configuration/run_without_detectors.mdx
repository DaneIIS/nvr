# Run without detectors

If you are only interested in recording 24/7 without running any sort of detection (motion, object, post processors) you can do so by using the following configuration:

This mode will use very little resources since the streams are never decoded.

```yaml title="/config/config.yaml"
ffmpeg: # Does NOT work with gstreamer as of now
  camera:
    camera_one:
      name: Camera 1
      host: !secret camera_one_host
      path: /Streaming/Channels/101/
      username: !secret camera_one_username
      password: !secret camera_one_password
      // highlight-start
      record_only: true
      recorder:
        continuous_recording: true  # Not needed since it is the default, included for clarity
        continuous:  # Example of setting a max size of 10 GB for this individual camera
          max_age:
            days: 7
      // highlight-end

nvr:
  camera_one:

```

## Viewing the recordings

The created recordings can be viewed using the `Timeline` tab on the `Events` page

## Considerations

Enabling the record only mode comes with a few drawbacks.

### Still image

The still image in the frontend camera cards is normally taken from the stream.
When `record_only: true` is set, the stream is never decoded and the still image will not work.

If your camera supports taking snapshots via URL, you can utilize that in Viseron instead.

Here is an example for a Hikvision camera:

```yaml title="/config/config.yaml"
ffmpeg:
  camera:
    camera_one:
      name: Camera 1
      host: !secret camera_one_host
      path: /Streaming/Channels/101/
      username: !secret camera_one_username
      password: !secret camera_one_password
      record_only: true
      recorder:
        continuous_recording: true  # Not needed since it is the default, included for clarity
        continuous:  # Example of setting a max size of 10 GB for this individual camera
          max_age:
            days: 7
      // highlight-start
      still_image:
        url: http://camera_one.lan:80/ISAPI/Streaming/channels/101/picture
        username: !secret camera_one_username
        password: !secret camera_one_password
        authentication: digest
      // highlight-end

nvr:
  camera_one:

```

### Live stream

The live stream which is accessed from the button on the camera card will not work either.
It is simply an MJPEG stream of what Viseron "sees", and since the stream is not decoded, Viseron never receives any frames.
This will change in the future and true live streams will be added.

Until then, you can utilize the `Events` page to view the stream in (near) real time.
It uses HLS so the delay is somewhere between 10-15 seconds.
